An assortment of LV2 plugins
============================

fluidsynth
----------

An effort at an LV2 version of the Fluidsynth synthesizer. Is kind of working
(you can play soundfonts), but the soundfont file path is hard-coded and you can
only select patches by number.

pitchdetect
-----------

Uses libaubio to convert incoming audio to pitch data. Unfortunately requires
a version of libaubio that's only currently available in git. It'll be 0.4
when it's finally released. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unM7bd0GZ0Y
to see it working.

shimmer
-------

A very simple tremolo type effect.

visual_compressor
-----------------

An effort at a compressor with visual feedback. 

amp_with_gui
------------

A very simple amp plugin with a gtk gui. Largely pointless in itself, but
worth a look if you want a simple example of an LV2 gui.
