 * <http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/event> ('lv2ev').
 *
 * This extension is a generic transport mechanism for time stamped events
 * of any type (e.g. MIDI, OSC, ramps, etc).  Each port can transport mixed
 * events of any type; the type of events and timestamps are defined by a URI
 * which is mapped to an integer by the host for performance reasons.
 *
 * This extension requires the host to support the LV2 URI Map extension.
 * Any host which supports this extension MUST guarantee that any call to
 * the LV2 URI Map uri_to_id function with the URI of this extension as the
 * 'map' argument returns a value within the range of uint16_t.
