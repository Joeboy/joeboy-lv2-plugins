/** @file
 * This header defines the LV2 URI Map extension with the URI
 * <http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/uri-map> (preferred prefix 'lv2urimap').
 *
 * This extension defines a simple mechanism for plugins to map URIs to
 * integers, usually for performance reasons (e.g. processing events
 * typed by URIs in real time).  The expected use case is for plugins to
 * map URIs to integers for things they 'understand' at instantiation time,
 * and store those values for use in the audio thread without doing any string
 * comparison.  This allows the extensibility of RDF with the performance of
 * integers (or centrally defined enumerations).

	 * the same arguments is guaranteed to return the same value over the life
	 * of a plugin instance (though the same URI may return different values
	 * with a different map parameter).  However, this function is not
	 * necessarily very fast: plugins should cache any IDs they might need in
	 * performance critical situations.
	 * The return value 0 is reserved and means an ID for that URI could not
	 * be created for whatever reason.  Extensions may define more precisely
	 * what this means, but in general plugins should gracefully handle 0
	 * and consider whatever they wanted the URI for "unsupported".
